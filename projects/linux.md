I started my Linux journey started after needing to reinstall windows on the computer for the umpteenth time. After that I resolved to find something other than windows, after searching I found Linux. Starting with Ubuntu 10.04 started learning more about how Linux works.




While wrapping up my Schooling for my Assoiates degree at Baker College I started working at the Michigan based hosting provider named Liquid Web.
